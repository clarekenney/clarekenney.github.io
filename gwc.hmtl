      <p style="color:#0000A0; padding-left: 250px; padding-right: 250px">Girl's Who Code is a 7 week summer immersion program that teaches girls how to code. By the year 2020, there is expected to be 1.4 computer specialist job openings, but only 29% of those jobs are predicted to be filled. Girl's Who Code hopes to equip girls with the computing skills to fill these job openings and help close the gender gap in technology. A few of the major corporations that sponsor Girls Who Code are GE, Google, Facebook, Groupon, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Accenture, Amazon, Intel, Goldman Sachs and many more.<br><br>

      Over the summer, I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program at General Electrics in Chicago. Through this program, I learned how to code in many different languages including Scratch, Python, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Not only did I learn how to code, I also gained the skills of networking and was fortunate to meet many inspiring CEO and CIO's of major technology companies. During this program, I was given a female mentor whom I met with every week. Through this mentor, I was given advice on college and career paths. At the end of the program, we were assigned a group for a final project. My group, known as thebendkrew and/or KCMO, brainstormed current problems we were having and our answer was the college process. My group created an application called PlanU, which helps you choose the colleges you want to apply to and it lets you add all of the important deadlines and requirements to your own personal calendar. Below are some pictures from my 7 weeks in Chicago featuring my final project group, some of my friends and Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girl's Who Code!</p></h4>
