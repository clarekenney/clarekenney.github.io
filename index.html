<h2>About Me</h2>

<h3>
<p style="font-family:Candara; font-size:18px;color:#0000A0;">Hello and welcome to my website. I am Clare Kenney. I am 19 years old and I am currently a freshman at Marquette University. I am passionate about science and technology and hope that I can make a difference in the future using my computing skills. I graduated from the Girl's Who Code Summer Immersion program at General Electrics in Chicago in 2015. My experience with Girls Who Code has influenced me to pursue a carreer in programming. I plan to major in computer science in college and hopefully minor in business. In this website, you will see some of my work I completed at Girl's Who Code and my resume. I hope you enjoy the website and feel free to contact me for any comments or questions. </p>

<h2>About this Site</h2>
<h3>I used my coding skills from Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program to hard code everything in this website. Instead of using Word Press or Wix, I decided to use my HTML/CSS skills to create my website from scratch. I am really enjoying developing this website because I am really learning how to become a better programmer with the new discoveries I make everyday. I hope you enjoy this HTML/CSS coded website as much as I enjoyed developing it!</h3>
